# JT Scripts Platform
JT Scripts Platform is a platform, that is resposible for launching other scripts. This idea was born, because I did not want to add my every single Python script to Window's Task Scheduler and manually configure it every time. Instead I only add this Platform's main script to the Scheduler to be run on Windows Startup, and it is responsible for dynamically launching other scripts in specified folder.

Current launching modes: Windows Startup

Launching modes to be added in the future: Windows Shutdown, Application Starting, Time intervals, Given time (13:30 for instance)
